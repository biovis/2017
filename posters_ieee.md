## General Information
The BioVis 2016 Posters track offers a venue to present and discuss new research in biological data visualization. Submissions take the form of a short (250-word) abstract with a supporting figure and are presented at the conference site as large format posters during a dedicated poster session. The BioVis symposium as a whole aims to promote interaction between the visualization, bioinformatics, and biology communities, and the BioVis poster session offers an interactive forum that encourages graphical presentation, demonstration, and active engagement with BioVis participants as well as all attendees of IEEE VIS.

## Important Dates

**August 26, 2016** - Poster submission to the BioVis symposium at IEEE VIS

**September 9, 2016** - Author notification of posters for the symposium 

Submission for BioVis@VIS: https://precisionconference.com/~vgtc/

## Submission
Example poster topics include, but are not limited to:

* Work-in-progress and preliminary results
* Previously published work from other venues
* Visualization challenges relevant to the BioVis community
* Extensions of Papers submissions and content that doesn’t fit Podium presentations
* Details about, or generalizations of contest submissions 

Please see the [Call for Participation](/cfp_vis.md/) for further details about topics of interest. 

**The following items are required for a complete poster submission:**
* A 250-word text-only abstract summarizing the subject matter of the poster. It is critical to clarify the target biological problem, the role of visualization, and the work’s relevance to BioVis.
* A single figure representative of the work in jpg or png format. It is particularly helpful for this image to illustrate how visualization is being employed to address a biological problem and it will be used as part of the poster submission reviewing process. An accompanying figure legend should be included in the appropriate field of the online submission form.
* A thumbnail image that will be used when posting the abstract on the BioVis web site (accepted posters only). The image must be a 400x300 pixel jpg or png file.
 
The large format poster itself is NOT required in the submission. We strongly encourage, but do not require, all authors to include an accompanying video or other supplementary materials.  Please limit supplementary material to widely accepted file formats such as MPEG (.mpg), QuickTime (.mov) or AVI (.avi) for videos; PDF for documents; and PNG or JPG for images. Please refer to the section Deadlines above for links to the conference submission systems.

## Review Process
Each poster submission will be read and evaluated by the Poster Chairs for quality and relevance to the BioVis venue with the goal of being as inclusive as possible and encouraging cross-domain interactions. Brief feedback will be provided as needed to support acceptance decisions, but authors should not expect detailed reviews. There will not be a revision cycle. Authors should check their initial abstract submission carefully as this is the copy that will appear on the BioVis web site.
