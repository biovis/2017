We're delighted to announce our primer and challenges speakers this year
for BioVis @ IEEE VIS. 

### Primers

### [Dr. Pierre Dragicevic](https://www.lri.fr/~dragice/) from [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/en/), France

Dr. Dragicevic will speak about the communication of statistical information which aligns
nicely with our design contest topic this year on the communication of bayesian statistics.
Pierre gave a magnificant talk on the (mis)communication of statistical information at IEEE VIS 2014 in Paris 
and we're excited to have him speak at BioVis this year!

### [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

Details coming soon...


### Challenges

We wanted to focus this year on the challenges faced in metagenomics 
research and how visualization both is and could be used to solve analytics
challenges.

While metagenomics is a continually growing field with projects such as the 
Earth and Human Microbiome projects making great strides to cataloging the variety
of microbial populations that exist in the sea, earth, human gut, skin, etc. the visualization
challenges are both plentiful and exciting. As such, we are delighted to invite Dr. Eric Fanzosa from
the Harvard School of Public Health who will be speaking about metagenomics, current visualization techniques,
and challenges both now and in the future in visualizing this data.


### [Dr. Eric Fanzosa](http://franzosa.net/) from the [Harvard School of Public Health](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/), USA
As such, we're delighted to have Dr. Fanzosa from the Harvard School of Public Health
speak about his research in the [Huttenhower lab](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/) who focus largely on 
metagenomics data analysis.
