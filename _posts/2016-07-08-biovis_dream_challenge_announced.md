The BioVis team is excited to announce the upcoming SMC-RNA BioVis Data Visualization DREAM Challenge. The challenge will invite the community to contribute innovative solutions for the visualization of transcript isoforms and gene/transcript fusions that allow investigators to gain new insights into RNA biology and human disease. 

The challenge is scheduled to launch in the summer of 2016 and is expected to run through the fall/winter of 2016. __Pre-registration to receive updates about this challenge__ is now possible through our [Synapse wiki site](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn6828822/wiki/402099) and a [slide deck outlining the challenge](http://www.slideshare.net/ngehlenborg/smcrna-biovis-data-visualization-dream-challenge-preview) is avaiable on SlideShare.
