The rapidly expanding application of experimental high-throughput and high-resolution methods in biology is creating enormous challenges for the visualization of biological data. To address these challenges, researchers in the visualization and bioinformatics communities need to engage in the **design, implementation, application, and evaluation of novel visualization techniques and tools** that provide insight into large and highly complex data sets.

The **BioVis Interest Group** organizes the annual BioVis conference. In its first five years, these BioVis conferences were organized as 2-day SIGs (Special Interest Groups) alternatively of [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org) and [ISMB](https://www.iscb.org/about-ismb). **In 2016, however, there will be two meetings; a symposium with IEEE VIS (BioVis@VIS), and a SIG meeting with ISMB (BioVis@ISMB)**

The BioVis meetings are intended to educate, inspire, and engage visualization researchers in problems in biological data visualization, as well as bioinformatics and biology researchers in state-of-the-art visualization research. The symposiums serve as a platform for researchers from these fields to increase the impact of data visualization approaches in biology, and to initiate interdisciplinary collaborations.
