<h3 id="scope">Aims and Scope</h3>
The rapidly expanding field of biology creates enormous challenges for data visualization techniques that enable researchers to gain insight from their large and highly complex data sets.

The BioVis Interest Group organizes the interdisciplinary event BioVis, covering all aspects of visualization in biology. This workshop brings together researchers from the visualization, bioinformatics, and biology communities with the purpose of educating, inspiring, and engaging visualization researchers in problems in biological data visualization as well as bioinformatics and biology researchers in state-of-the-art visualization research.


<h3 id="topics">Topics of Interest</h3>

We invite contributions on all aspects of data visualization in biology, from molecular to cell, tissue, organism and population biology. Suggested topics for abstract submissions include, but are not limited to:

- Genome and sequence data, including genomic variation data
- Multivariate omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.)
- Phylogenetic data
- Biological networks and pathways
- Biological ontologies
- Macromolecular structures (e.g., protein or RNA structures)
- Biological image data, such as microscopy data
- Integration of image and omics data for systems biology
- Modeling and simulation of biological systems
- Neurobiology and developmental biology
- Systems and software frameworks
- Biological workflows or collaborative processes
- Usability of visualization by biologists
- Biological atlases and metadata
- Processes for interdisciplinary collaboration between biology and visualization.


<h3 id="subType">Submissions Types </h3>

There are 3 types of submissions:

[1] ISMB Proceedings: papers to go into Bioinformatics, and presented as talks

[2] BioVis Proceedings: papers expected to go into BMC Bioinformatics, a selection of which will be selected for talks

[3] Posters, a selection of which will be selected for short talks
