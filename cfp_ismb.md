## BioVis@ISMB 2016

The rapidly expanding field of biology creates enormous challenges for the computational visualization techniques that are necessary in order to enable researchers to gain insight from their large and highly complex data sets.

The BioVis Interest Group (http://www.biovis.net) is organizing two meetings in 2016. In addition to the **BioVis@ISMB meeting** described here, the **BioVis@VIS** meeting will be taking place at the IEEE VIS conference in October 2016. The main difference between the two meetings are the types of submissions that will be accepted to accommodate our diverse community: *BioVis@ISMB will only accept abstracts*, while *BioVis@VIS will accept full papers* that will undergo comprehensive peer-review and get published, as well as poster submissions. 

Both meetings bring together researchers from the visualization, bioinformatics, and biology communities with the purpose of educating, inspiring, and engaging visualization researchers in problems in biological data visualization, as well as bioinformatics and biology researchers in state-of-the-art visualization research. 

There are three possibilities to contribute to the program at BioVis@ISMB 2016:

1. **New Research**
Participants are invited to submit an abstract describing high-quality original research. Abstracts will be reviewed by the program committee and all accepted abstracts will be included in the poster session. The authors of selected abstracts will be asked to give a brief oral presentation during the SIG meeting. 

1. **Highlights**
Participants may submit an abstract describing work published in the previous year as well as additional work undertaken since publication. The program committee will review these abstracts. Additionally, the BioVis SIG program committee may also invite authors of outstanding publications from other venues. The authors of selected abstracts will give an oral presentation during the SIG meeting. 

1. **Posters**
We seek work in progress and preliminary results; previously published work from other venues; visualization challenges.


### Submission
Submissions consist of a **500 word abstract and two images for the New Research and Highlights Track** or a **250 word abstract and one image for the Poster Track**. For details about what and how to submit and about our review process please see the [Submission Information](/2016/submission_ismb) page.

### Location and Registration
BioVis@ISMB2016 is co-located with [ISMB 2016](http://www.iscb.org/ismb2016) and will be taking place on July 8 in [Orlando, Florida at the Disney World Resort Swan and Dolphin hotel](http://www.iscb.org/ismb2016-accommodation). The main ISMB 2016 conference will run from July 8 through July 12.

As BioVis@ISMB is an ISMB Special Interest Group Meeting, [registration for the meeting is managed through the ISMB conference](http://www.iscb.org/ismb2016program/ismb2016-sigs#biovis).

### Topics of Interest

We invite contributions on all aspects of data visualization in biology, from molecular to cell, tissue, organism and population biology. Suggested topics for abstract submissions include, but are not limited to:

- Genome and sequence data, including genomic variation data
- Multivariate omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.)
- Phylogenetic data
- Biological networks and pathways
- Biological ontologies
- Macromolecular structures (e.g., protein or RNA structures)
- Biological image data, such as microscopy data
- Integration of image and omics data for systems biology
- Modeling and simulation of biological systems
- Neurobiology and developmental biology
- Systems and software frameworks
- Biological workflows or collaborative processes
- Usability of visualization by biologists
- Biological atlases and metadata
- Processes for interdisciplinary collaboration between biology and visualization.
