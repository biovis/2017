- Phylogenetic data
- Biological networks and pathways
- Biological ontologies
- Macromolecular structures (e.g., protein or RNA structures)
- Biological image data, such as microscopy data
- Integration of image and omics data for systems biology
- Modeling and simulation of biological systems
- Neurobiology and developmental biology
- Systems and software frameworks
- Biological workflows or collaborative processes
- Usability of visualization by biologists
- Biological atlases and metadata
- Processes for interdisciplinary collaboration between biology and visualization.
