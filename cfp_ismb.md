- Genome and sequence data, including genomic variation data
- Multivariate omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.)
- Phylogenetic data
- Biological networks and pathways
- Biological ontologies
- Macromolecular structures (e.g., protein or RNA structures)
- Biological image data, such as microscopy data
- Integration of image and omics data for systems biology
